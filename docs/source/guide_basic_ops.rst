Basic Operations
================

In this section, we will intrduce how to use TensorToolbox to perform basic operations on both matrics and tensors.



DTensor: unfold(张量->矩阵), t2mat(张量->矩阵),
         kron(张量乘法), khatri(张量间乘法),
         加法, Hadamard乘法(同形张量),
         减法, fold(矩阵->张量)

basic: unfold(张量->矩阵), fold, t2mat, vectorize(张量->向量), vec_to_tensor,
       mul(张量间乘法tensor contraction), ttm(张量x一堆矩阵)
