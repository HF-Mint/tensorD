Introduction of tensorD

tensorD is a tensor decomposition library that builds the framework using Tensorflow,
provides basic decomposition such as Tucker decomposition,
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, and the expansion of special forms,
for example, Pairwise Interaction Tensor Decomposition.
The features of \emph{tensorD} are that its internal functions all use the interface provided by Tensorflow,
and it can be embedded directly into your Tensorflow-based code when needed.
